This file contains all the code written for a Unity VR simulation dedicated to a reaction testing game.
The test drops cylindrical objects from an elevated surface at random intervals, which the user has to
catch. The code simulattd the randomized dropping, catching, and game mechanics. 

The VR code also programmed a VR simulation for a target practice game, where a user would pick up a
model firearm and shoot projectiles towards a variety of targets. The C# code is used for programming
the firearm, VR hand controls, the projectile simulation, the target reactions, and the game mechanics.
